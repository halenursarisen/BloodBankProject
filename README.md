Project Purpose 
 
This project aims to create an administration panel for a blood donation center. The administration panel will provide users with the ability to log in and view, update, and manage the center's stock information through an interface. Users will be able to add, update, and delete blood stocks. Additionally, the project will include a contact page allowing users to view contact information between centers, enabling them to reach out when necessary. The goal of this project is to facilitate efficient management of blood donation centers and effective monitoring of blood stocks.
